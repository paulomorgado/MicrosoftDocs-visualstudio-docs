## Cause

## Rule description

By default, the Trusted Root Certification Authorities certificate store is configured with a set of public CAs that has met the requirements of the Microsoft Root Certificate Program. Since all trusted root CAs can issue certificates for any domain, an attacker can pick a weak or coercible CA that you install by yourself to target for an attack â€“ and a single vulnerable, malicious or coercible CA undermines the security of the entire system. To make matters worse, these attacks can go unnoticed quite easily.
